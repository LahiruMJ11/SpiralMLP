# SpiralMLP
SpiralMLP is a lightweight, state-of-the-art vision model based on Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) that uses a novel Spiral FC layer to capture both local and global features in images. It achieves competitive performance on various benchmarks like ImageNet, COCO, and ADE20K, comparable to Transformers and CNNs, while maintaining a linear computational complexity (\(O(HW)\)) and compatibility with different image resolutions. This architecture offers potential benefits for businesses by reducing cost and increasing scalability, making MLPs a viable and evolving option for computer vision tasks.Â
